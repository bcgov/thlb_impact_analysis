# THLB Impact Analysis
This repository contains tools which help to answer the question of what impact
an input shape / Polygon would have on the Timber Harvesting Land Base (THLB). A 
common reason someone may want this analysis complete would be to determine the 
impact of proposed Wildlife Habitat Areas (WHA) on the timber industry. The 
goal is to quantify THLB redu tion due to non-harvest and conditional harvest 
areas.

>[!Note]
>There are important terms relevant to understanding this analysis:
><strong>Gross Land Base (GLB):</strong>Tenure Area or Total Area<br />
><strong>Forest Management Land Base (FMLB):</strong> Forested Area that contributes to forest management objectives (GLB, minus water, long term leases, other tenures, non forested areas)<br />
><strong>Legally Harvestable Land Base (LHLB):</strong> Area within the FMLB where timber harvesting is legal, subject to forest mamagement objectives and requiremnets. 
><strong>Timber Harvesting Land Base (THLB): </strong>Area within the THLB where it is economical to harvest under current management practices (LHLB minus environmentally sensitive areas, steep slopes, non merchantable timber, etc.)
