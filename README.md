# THLB Impact Analysis
This repository contains tools which help to answer the question of what impact
an input shape / Polygon would have on the Timber Harvesting Land Base (THLB). A 
common reason someone may want this analysis complete would be to determine the 
impact of proposed Wildlife Habitat Areas (WHA) on the timber industry. The 
goal is to quantify THLB redu tion due to non-harvest and conditional harvest 
areas.
