# THLB Impact Analysis
This repository contains tools which help to answer the question of what impact
an input shape / Polygon would have on the Timber Harvesting Land Base (THLB). A 
common reason someone may want this analysis complete would be to determine the 
impact of proposed Wildlife Habitat Areas (WHA) on the timber industry. The 
goal is to quantify THLB redu tion due to non-harvest and conditional harvest 
areas.

>[!Note]
><strong>Gross Land Base (GLB): </strong>Tenure Area or Total Area<br />
><strong>Forest Management Land Base (FMLB): </strong>Forested Area that contributes to forest management objectives (GLB, minus water, long term leases, other tenures, non forested areas)<br />
><strong>Legally Harvestable Land Base (LHLB): </strong>Area within the FMLB where timber harvesting is legal, subject to forest mamagement objectives and requiremnets. <br />
><strong>Timber Harvesting Land Base (THLB): </strong>Area within the THLB where it is economical to harvest under current management practices (LHLB minus environmentally sensitive areas, steep slopes, non merchantable timber, etc.)

## THLB Data
The location of THLB can be found through an internal local directory as an ESRI
file geodatabase or via a [file transfer protocol (ftp) page](https://www.for.gov.bc.ca/ftp/HTS/external/!publish/DataCatalogue_FAIB_Data/THLB/). The internal file
geodatabase is preferred for this analysis as it is seamless. The ftp links have 
been separated into Timber Supply Area / Timber Farm License areas due to size 
limitations. 

>[!Note]
><strong>Tree Farm Licences (TFL) </strong>are area-based tenures which grant nearly exclusive rights to harvest timber and manage forests on a specified area of land.><br />
><br />
><strong>Timber Supply Areas (TSA) </strong>are geographically defined areas used for timver supply planning. Harvesting rights are allocated through volume-based tenures such as Forest Licences rather than exclusive area based rights.
